# Cookie Consent Block List

With [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net) or [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) you can easily block services that track your online behaviour and violate your privacy. Since the service is blocked, even when you "approve all" cookies, the cookies aren't set in your browser.

So, if there are no cookies anyway, why bother approving/rejecting on consent screens?

You can add this list to your blocklists: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickHeneise/blocklist/main/consent-block.txt
